            <p class="Thanksgiving_intro-text">To some, turkey is a <span class="red_text">succulent holiday centerpiece</span>—to others, merely a vehicle for gravy. Whichever camp you fall into,
            knowing how to cook and prepare a turkey so it emerges from the oven golden on the outside and juicy within is the key
            to keeping everyone happy. Whether you’re a <span class="red_text">Thanksgiving</span> pro ready to try something new (Will it be a spatchcocked turkey this year? A grilled
            bird? How about <span class="red_text">confit</span>? ) or a holiday-hosting newbie preparing a <span class="red_text">whole turkey</span> (or even a <span class="red_text">turkey breast</span>) for the first
            time, allow this to be your guiding principle: You don’t need a complicated Thanksgiving turkey recipe; just stick to
            the basics and let the side dishes make it a show. Ahead you’ll find everything you need to know, including step-by-step
            instructions for cooking and preparing the best turkey for your holiday table.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>1. Thaw your turkey.</h3>
            <p>The ideal place to thaw a frozen turkey is in the fridge. Depending on the size of your bird, this can take up to a
            week. Want to brine your turkey? Now’s the time. If you go with a wet brine, you can submerge a frozen turkey right away; for
            a dry brine, wait a day or two until you can remove the giblets from the turkey cavity and the skin is more pliable,
            which will allow it to better hold on to the rub. (A fresh turkey should also get some dry brine action at least one to
            two days before cooking.)</p>
            <div>
                <span></span>
                <h5>How long it takes to thaw turkey in the fridge on average:</h5>
                <p>4–12 lb.: 1 to 3 days</p>
                <p>12–16 lb.: 3 to 4 days</p>
                <p>16–20 lb.: 4 to 5 days</p>
                <p>20–24 lb.: 5 to 6 days</p>
            </div>
        
            <h3>2. Temper your turkey.</h3>
            <p>About one hour before you plan to cook your turkey, remove it from the fridge—it’ll cook more evenly when it’s not super
            chilled. Set it on a roasting rack—one that allows the turkey to sit at or just below the top of your largest roasting
            pan (this will allow air to circulate all around the bird, which will help you achieve crispy skin across the turkey’s
            entire surface). No roasting pan? You can also use a <span class="red_text">cooling rack set inside a large sheet pan</span>.</p>
            <h3>3. Tidy up the turkey.</h3>
            <p>If you haven’t yet removed the giblets, do so now. Check the neck cavity too. If you’d like, save the neck and giblets
            for <span class="red_text">stock</span>, <span class="red_text">stuffing</span>, <span class="red_text">gravy</span>, or <span class="red_text">another use</span>. You might also come across the occasional feather quill stuck in the
            bird—you can yank these out with your fingers or with some clean <span class="red_text">needle-nose pliers</span>.</p>
            <h3>4. Prep your oven.</h3>
            <p>About 15 minutes before you plan to roast, position your oven rack on the lowest rung and preheat the oven to 350°F.
            Some recipes instruct you to briefly roast the turkey at a high oven temperature before lowering the heat for the
            duration of the cooking time. The belief is that the high heat “sears” the bird and the low heat gently cooks it
            through, yielding a turkey that’s juicier and more succulent than average. We haven’t found this method to make a huge
            difference, and it can cause the skin to brown very quickly (often too quickly). Steady heat means less tending to,
            freeing you up to do other things, like prep your <span class="red_text">mashed potatoes</span> and other Thanksgiving <span class="red_text">side dishes</span>.</p>
            <h3>5. Butter your turkey and season your turkey (if necessary).</h3>
            <p>Set your turkey breast side up on the roasting rack and rub room-temperature salted butter—or your favorite <span class="red_text">flavored
            compound butter</span>—all over it. (For a 12-to-14-pound turkey, you’ll need about ½ cup [1 stick] of butter.) Slowly work
            your fingers under the skin, starting at the neck, being careful not to tear the skin or separate it completely at the
            large cavity. Rub most of the butter under the skin, a little inside the large cavity, and the rest over the skin. If you’ve chosen to brine your bird (via a wet brine or dry brine), you can skip this final seasoning. For kosher
            turkeys, which are already salted, there’s no need to salt the cavity, but you will want to salt the skin. Here’s how to
            do it: For a 12-to-14-pound bird, sprinkle 1½ teaspoons each kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper in the large
            cavity and another 1½ teaspoons each over the skin. You can add other <span class="red_text">ground spices</span> and <span class="red_text">seasonings</span> to your mix at this
            point too.</p>
            <h3>7. Stuff the neck cavity but not the main cavity and add some aromatics.</h3>
            <p>Sounds random, we know. But stuffing the neck cavity (not the large cavity) with a halved apple—placing the cut side
            against the turkey’s flesh with the rounded side facing out—buffers the breast from heat, protecting it from
            overcooking. But <span class="red_text">don’t fill the main cavity with stuffing—it</span>’ll only slow down your cooking time. Instead, prep your
            <span class="red_text">stuffing recipe</span> in a <span class="red_text">casserole dish</span> and bake it on the side.</p>
            <h3>Cover (and then uncover) the turkey and calculate turkey cooking time and temperature.</h3>
            <p>The simplest way to figure out turkey roasting times is to calculate 13 minutes per pound at 350°F for an <span class="red_text">unstuffed turkey</span>
             (that’s about 3 hours for a 12-to-14-lb. turkey), or 15 minutes per pound for a <span class="red_text">stuffed turkey</span>. Check the
            temperature about three quarters of the way through that time, and then again every 10 minutes, and roast until the
            temperature reads 165°F (or 150°F as the case may be; more on that below) when checked at the thickest part of the thigh
            meat and the thickest part of the breast meat.</p>

            <h4>Cooking time per pound of turkey:</h4>
            <p>For an 8-to-12-pound turkey:</p>
            <p>400°F for 2½ to 2¾ hours</p>
            <p>350°F for 2¾ to 3 hours</p>
            <p>325°F for 3 to 3¾ hours</p>

            <h4>For a 21-to-24-pound turkey:</h4>
            <p>400°F for 4¼ to 4½ hours</p>
            <p>350°F for 4½ to 4¾ hours</p>
            <p>325°F for 4¾ to 5 hours</p>
